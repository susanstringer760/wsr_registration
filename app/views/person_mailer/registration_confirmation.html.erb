<% if (@person.meal_preference.eql?('none')) %>
The YMCA can occommodate vegetarian or gluten free meal options (not vegan, but there is a salad bar).  I sincerely apologize for the urgency of this information. It would be extremely helpful if you could reply to this message with your meal preference in the subject of the email, even if you don't have one so we can provide the YMCA with accurate information by tomorrow.  Again, I apologize for the inconvience. You can also call myself (303-818-5742) or Joanne (303-552-1396/sensabama@aol.com).

Thanks!
